1. What was the bug?
   -> at first when I typed in two numbers, for example 2 and 4 it would give me 24 as a result. So the two numbers were strings before and were concatenated as one string

2. How would I fix it?
   -> Change the two strings into integers


Screenshots of debugging process are in different file


1. When the debugger is triggered, set a breakpoint at the initialization of the local variable result in calculateSum(). 
-Take a screenshot of the list of breakpoints containing the breakpoint you just added. 
-Name it result-calculateSum.png 

2. Add watch expressions to find the value of num1 and num2, and the data type of result. 
-Take a screenshot of the watch expressions list. 
-Name it result-dataType.png
